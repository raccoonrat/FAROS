"""
ResearchPlan Domain Model

Scientific Responsibility:
- Represent pre-execution scientific intent
- Enforce hypothesis-driven research methodology
- Maintain immutability for scientific integrity
- Separate conceptual design from execution details

A ResearchPlan answers:
- What question are we asking?
- What hypothesis are we testing?
- What variables are involved?
- What methodology will be used?

It does NOT specify:
- Which GPU to use
- Which file paths to read
- How many iterations to run
(Those are Run concerns)
